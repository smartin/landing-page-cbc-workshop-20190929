# Starter Project for the HTML/CSS Workshop

This is an example of the final code for the project that we did during the workshop.

## Project Files

### ← index.html

That's where all of the HTML, i.e. the content, is located.

### ← style.css

That's where we're going to be writign all of the CSS for the page, i.e. the styling (presentational customizations) are located.

### ← assets

That's where you would save assets for your website.

We won't be using that folder in this project but you could easily use this for assets instead of the unsplash image that we added to the project. You can drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project.

### Other Folders

There are two other folders in the project: "css", and "part". This is where I keep some of the magic for behind the scenes. You should not have to go in there directly, but you never know.

### Finished Project

See the [finished project](). (It may not be exactly the same as the page you worked on today, as we are always changing the workshop!)
